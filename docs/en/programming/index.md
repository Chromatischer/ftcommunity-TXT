* As a beginner, the easisest way is to use the graphical programming environment [Brickly](brickly).

* Or you can write [Python](python) programs that use the ftrobopy library to access the I/O ports of your TXT

* And of course, [ROBOPro](robopro.md) can be used as well, just as with the original firmware
